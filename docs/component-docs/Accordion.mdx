import { Accordion, Text } from "../../src/index";

The accordion component is a vertically stacked list of headers that can be clicked to reveal or hide content
associated with them.

### Usage

The actual `Accordion` component acts as a container for the accordion whereas the `Accordion.Item` acts as the item list
container, which comes as a child to `Accordion`. The `Accordion.Item` has two props `header` which is the header of the
list and the `key` which is used to uniquely identify this item in list. The content is given as child to `Accordion.Item`.

<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item header="Accordion Header 1" key={1}>
    <Text>Accordion Content 1</Text>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item header="Accordion Header 2" key={2}>
    <Text>Accordion Content 2</Text>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
<br />

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item header="Accordion Header 1" key={1}>
    <Text>Accordion Content 1</Text>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item header="Accordion Header 2" key={2}>
    <Text>Accordion Content 2</Text>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

### Current Active

The current active list item can be given by using the `active` prop which is a boolean. It is given to `Accordion.Item`

<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item active header="Accordion Header 1" key={1}>
    <Text>Accordion Content 1</Text>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item header="Accordion Header 2" key={2}>
    <Text>Accordion Content 2</Text>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>

<br />

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item active header="Accordion Header 1" key={1}>
    <Text>Accordion Content 1</Text>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item header="Accordion Header 2" key={2}>
    <Text>Accordion Content 2</Text>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```
